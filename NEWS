  Since mailgen:90fbd467770d65d9cb903500ff63f2cdb64a32d5 (20170217)
  changes to the event and contact data will take an faster effect.
  Technical: Because some database transactions are ended earlier than before,
  when using the api that Fody also uses.

### Upgrade

* certbund-contact, api, fody, technical:
  The contactdb_api module must be installed to it can be imported
  by checkticket.py. The webserver must use single-thread processes
  to serve the api, to avoid write conflicts. A postgresql user must be
  created that has write access to the "manual" tables.

RELEASE 01                                                    2017-01-31

intelmq 1.0.0~dev6+intevation.1.2
---------------------------------

BUG FIXES

* Bots:

  - Parser - ShadowServer

    For the Open-LDAP feed `dns_host_name' is now mapped to
    `source.local_hostname' instead of `destination.local_hostname'.


NEW FEATURES

* Bots:

  - Collector - Generic Mail URL Fetcher
    Collector - Generic URL Fetcher

    Bots do no longer hang, if the download connection does not terminate.

  - Parser - ShadowServer

    Improved Logging: non DHO fields are only reported on log level
    "DEBUG" (no longer on "INFO") and warnings are generated if the
    shadow server format changes.

  - Expert - Modify

    Evaluation order of the Rules is now deterministic


UPGRADE

* from 1.0.0~dev4+intevation.1.2~beta4testbuild20160930133128
  (upgrade from older Versions is untested)

  For generic upgrade instructions see below.


  Dependencies:

  If you are using intelmq-mailgen, note that you will need at least
  version 0.95~beta3 or later.


  Configuration:

  The startup.conf was deprecated in this release, it is substituted
  by integrating the information into runtime.conf.  To migrate to the
  unified runtime.conf:

    # Run intelmqctl once, this will automatically generate a file
    # runtime.conf.new: 
    su - intelmq -c 'intelmqctl status'
    # Move the old configuration out of the way and use the new file:
    mv /opt/intelmq/etc/runtime.conf /opt/intelmq/etc/runtime.conf.OLD_WITH_STARTUP_CONF
    mv /opt/intelmq/etc/startup.conf /opt/intelmq/etc/startup.conf.OLD
    mv /opt/intelmq/etc/runtime.conf.new /opt/intelmq/etc/runtime.conf

  The system.conf is deprecated.  The information is now stored in
  defaults.conf.  Merge your settings from
  `/opt/intelmq/etc/system.conf' into `/opt/intelmq/etc/defaults.conf',
  then delete `/opt/intelmq/etc/system.conf'.

  
  Bot Specific:

  - Collector - Generic Mail URL Fetcher
    Collector - Generic URL Fetcher

    The configuration parameter `http_ssl_proxy' was renamed to
    `https_proxy', you can update your existing configuration bu a
    simple search and replace:

      sed -i 's/http_ssl_proxy/https_proxy/' /opt/intelmq/etc/runtime.conf

  - Parser - ShadowServer

    `override' is deprecated, it is now called `overwrite':

      sed -i 's/override/overwrite/' /opt/intelmq/etc/runtime.conf

    If you are using the OpenLDAP feed in combination with a db output
    you might want to fix your existing data to reflect the new
    mapping of `dns_host_name' (see BUG FIXES above).  To do so, you
    can use the following SQL statement on you events-database:

      UPDATE events
         SET "source.local_hostname"="destination.local_hostname",
             "destination.local_hostname"=DEFAULT
       WHERE "feed.name"='Open-LDAP' AND "source.local_hostname" IS NULL;

  - Expert - Modify

    The semantics of the configuration have slightly changed, see:
    https://github.com/certtools/intelmq/pull/745
    the configuration is supposed to be backwards compatible, never
    the less you should verify, that the results are still like
    expected.

  - Outputs - PostgreSQL

    A new field was added to the events description.  To reflect this
    in an existing database, add the field as db admin on the database
    server:

      su - postgres
      psql intelmq-events -c 'ALTER TABLE events ADD "feed.provider" text;'
      exit
