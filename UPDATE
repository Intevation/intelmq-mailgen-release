Generic Upgrade Instructions
----------------------------

All steps are executed as root user, unless stated otherise.

Before upgrading intelmq should be stopped:

  su - intelmq -c 'intelmqctl stop'

NOTE: If there are still events in the queue they will be processed
  after restarting IntelMQ with the new bots from the upgrade.  In
  some rare cases this might lead to unwanted behavior.  To prevent
  this its best to first stop all collector bots and wait for the
  queues to empty before stopping the rest oft IntelMQ.

when running the IntelMQ Manager stopping the web server should be
considered, too:

  service apache2 stop

Then upgrade to the latest packages, either using dpkg or `apt
upgrade'.  Follow the release specific upgrade notes above, the start
IntelMQ again:

  su - intelmq -c 'intelmqctl start'

If you stopped the web server, restart it, too:

  service apache2 start
