# IntelMQ Mailgen Release

If a more complex contact database for sending out events via
email and other means is necessary, a combination of software components
can be used:

1. [IntelMQ](https://github.com/Intevation/intelmq/tree/integrated) from our integrated-branch.
2. [Certbund Contact Export and Rule bots](https://github.com/Intevation/intelmq-certbund-contact)
2. [IntelMQ Manager](https://github.com/certtools/intelmq-manager)
3. [IntelMQ Mailgen](https://github.com/intevation/intelmq-mailgen)
4. [Fody-Backend](https://github.com/intevation/intelmq-fody-backend)
5. [Fody](https://github.com/intevation/intelmq-fody)

Our working label for the combination is __intelmq-cb-mailgen__.
The setup requires PostgreSQL.
