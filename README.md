# IntelMQ Mailgen Release

If a more complex contact database for sending out events via
email and other means is necessary, a combination of software components
can be used:

1. IntelMQ from the certbund-contact 'branch', which needs PostgreSQL.
2. IntelMQ Manager
3. [IntelMQ Mailgen](https://github.com/intevation/intelmq-mailgen)
4. [Fody](https://github.com/intevation/intelmq-fody)

Our working label for the combination is __intelmq-cb-mailgen__.

Collection of stuff to manage releases of intelmq-cb-mailgen.  The
information which versions of intelmq, intelmq-mailgen,
intelmq-manager and further components form a specific release is
administered here.
